						<h2>About</h2>
						<p>Welcome to Tavi's Tacos! Our journey began in 1998 when Tavi Hernandez, a passionate culinary artist, started a humble taco stand. For years, Tavi delighted customers with traditional tacos crafted with authentic Mexican flavors. However, in 2005, Tavi's adventurous spirit led him to explore new and exciting culinary horizons. He grew bored of the conventional style and decided to create a unique twist on tacos by introducing exotic varieties.

	Tavi's innovative approach paid off as customers eagerly embraced the new flavors, and his sales soared beyond expectations. This success fueled Tavi's dream of opening a taco shop. In 2012, that dream became a reality. After a year of construction and an additional month of securing supplies, Tavi's Tacos opened its doors to the community.

	Since then, Tavi and his dedicated team have been crafting exotic tacos that tantalize taste buds and ignite the senses. While we pride ourselves on our inventive and adventurous taco creations, we also honor tradition by offering classic options for those who cherish the familiar.

	At Tavi's Tacos, our mission is to deliver exceptional dining experiences that celebrate the rich flavors and vibrant culture of Mexican cuisine. We are committed to using the freshest ingredients, embracing culinary innovation, and serving our community with passion and dedication.

	Join us on this flavorful journey and savor the best exotic and traditional tacos in town. Welcome to Tavi's Tacos, where every bite is an adventure!</p>
